# Channels overview

Pusher Channels provides realtime communication between servers, apps and devices. Channels is used for realtime charts, realtime user lists, realtime maps, multiplayer gaming, and many other kinds of UI updates.

## Something

When something happens in your system, it can update web-pages, apps and devices. When an event happens on an app, the app can notify all other apps and your system. For example, if the price of Bitcoin changes, your system could update the display of all open apps and web-pages. Or if Bob starts typing a message, his app could tell Alice's app to display "Bob is typing ...".

## Another something

Pusher Channels has libraries for everything: web browsers, iOS and Android apps, PHP frameworks, cloud functions, bash scripts, IoT devices. Pusher Channels works everywhere because it uses WebSockets and HTTP, and provides fallbacks for devices that don't support WebSockets.
